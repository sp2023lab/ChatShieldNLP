- **Conversation tracking** ‚Äì recent scores are accumulated in `AppState`  
- **Runs fully offline** once Tesseract is installed  
- Text or image input (OCR via Tesseract).
- Rule‚Äëbased safety scoring with intensity filter (Easy=0.55, Medium=0.30).

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1) Clone & enter
git clone https://github.com/sp2023lab/ChatShieldNLP.git
cd ChatShieldNLP

# 2) Create venv
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
# source venv/bin/activate

# 3) Install deps
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4) (Windows) Install Tesseract OCR:
#   https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

# 5) Run
python main.py
```

## How it works (tl;dr)
- Normalize text (unicode fold, leetspeak cleanup), then run regex rules.
- Each rule contributes a weight; total score ‚àà [0,1].
- Intensity filter gates results: Easy‚â•0.55, Medium‚â•0.30.
- OCR runs in a worker thread; UI stays responsive.

## üì¶ Requirements

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Tesseract OCR** (for screenshots, optional if you only analyze text)  
  - Windows typical paths:  
    - `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\Programs\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe`  
    - `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe`
- Python packages:
  - `PyQt6`
  - `pytesseract`
  - `Pillow`

---

## Troubleshooting
**pytesseract not found**  
Activate your venv and run:
```bash
pip install pytesseract Pillow
```
